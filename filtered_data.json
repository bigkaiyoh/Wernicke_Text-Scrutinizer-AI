[{"test_framework":"IELTS","test_section":"Writing","user_input":"\"This scheme describes the changes in a structure of a student accomodation building between 2010 and present time.\n The main entrance and the student-bedroom to the left of it remain the same. As for the garden to the right of the hallway, it was transformed to the car parking. The hallway area has reduced significantly due to the fresh built en-suite room that is now adjacent to the student-bedroom in the end of the hallway. The kitchen now includes a social area for students. The bathroom opposite to kitchen did not change at all. The living room left to the bathroom is now transformed to another student-bedroom with the passage leading to the room on the right, and its indoor entrance has shifted to the left. The part of the garden behind a former livingroom was turned into additional student-bedroom with two entraces: the first entry is located outdoors, while the second is available only indoors.\"","Wernicke_output":"**Overall Band Score: 6**\n\n**Task Achievement**: \n\n- The text appears to describe the changes accurately but lacks explicit indication of the precise timeframe between 2010 and the present, which is essential to Task 1.\n\n**Coherence and Cohesion**:\n\n- Idea organization: Largely logical but could be enhanced with clearer progression and signposting.\n- Reference devices are used (e.g., \"it,\" \"the hallway\"), but at times they can be more precise to avoid confusion.\n\n**Lexical Resource**:\n\n- Vocabulary is adequate for the task, but greater variety and precision would reach higher bands.\n- Use of less common items and collocations occasionally present (e.g., \"transformed to the car parking\").\n\n**Grammatical Range and Accuracy**:\n\n- Some grammatically complex structures are used correctly; however, there are errors that affect meaning.\n- Errors such as \"the fresh built en-suite room\" and \"indoor entrance has shifted to the left\" may cause confusion.\n\n**Recognize Strengths**:\n\n- The writer has a reasonable understanding of the task requirements.\n- The changes in structure are described in a sequence that reflects the layout of the building.\n- There is an attempt to use a range of vocabulary appropriate for the task.\n\n**Identify and Explain Errors**:\n\n- \"The main entrance and the student-bedroom to the left of it remain the same.\" \u279d \"The main entrance and the adjoining student bedroom to its left have remained unchanged.\"\n- \"it was transformed to the car parking\" \u279d \"it was transformed into a car park.\"\n- \"The hallway area has reduced significantly\" \u279d \"The hallway area has been significantly reduced\"\n- \"the fresh built en-suite room\" \u279d \"the newly constructed en-suite room\"\n- \"the bathroom opposite to kitchen did not change at all\" \u279d \"the bathroom opposite the kitchen remains unchanged.\"\n\n**Advanced Language Suggestions**:\n\n- To enhance sophistication: \"The once tranquil garden beside the hallway has given way to a bustling car park.\"\n- For greater variety: \"The kitchen now doubles as a social hub for students.\"\n- Idiomatic language: Describe the transformation of the living room into a bedroom with phrases like \"the living room was repurposed into an additional bedroom\" for a more natural sound.\n\n**Contextual Relevance**:\n\n- The descriptions provided are contextually relevant but could be more detailed for an IELTS Task 1 Academic response.\n\n**Feedback on Structure and Coherence**:\n\n- An introductory sentence outlining the general trend of the changes would improve coherence.\n- Further breakdown of the text into more structured paragraphs discussing the changes systematically would enhance clarity.\n- The use of linkers such as \"Furthermore,\" \"In addition to,\" or \"As a result,\" would provide better connections between sentences.\n\n**Encourage Self-Reflection**:\n\n- Reflect on the use of prepositions and articles as their misuse can alter the meaning of a sentence.\n- Consider the impact of verb tense consistency on the clarity of temporal changes.\n\n**Continuous Improvement Plan**:\n\n- Practice writing compound and complex sentences to increase grammatical range.\n- Work on precise word choice, particularly with prepositions and collocations.\n- Develop the skill of summarizing and paraphrasing to avoid repetitions and create a concise report.\n\n**Constructive and Supportive Feedback**:\n\n- Keep practicing the use of specific descriptive language in the context of building and room functions.\n- You're on the right track. Focus on refining the areas of grammar and vocabulary where errors were found for an even stronger performance next time."}]
